# Machine Learning Accelerated Transient Analysis of Stochastic Nonlinear Structures
This paper presents a non-intrusive surrogate modeling scheme for transient response analysis of nonlinear structures involving random parameters. The proposed scheme utilizes a two-level neural network architecture as a surrogate model. Specifically, it consists of a feed-forward neural network and a convolutional autoencoder and is capable of emulating the structural system's behavior at low cost and high accuracy. To build the surrogate, an initial set of full model evaluations is performed for a small number of parameter values that serves as the initial training data set. A convolutional autoencoder is then trained over the corresponding solution matrices in order to obtain a low-dimensional vector representation through its encoder and a reconstruction map by the decoder. Subsequently, a feed forward Neural Network is efficiently trained to map points from the parametric space to the latent space given by the encoder, which can be further mapped to the actual, high-dimensional, system responses by the decoder mapping. The proposed surrogate is capable of predicting the entire time history response almost instantaneously and with remarkable accuracy, despite the nonlinearities present in the system's response. The elaborated methodology is demonstrated on the stochastic nonlinear transient analysis of single and multi degree of freedom structural systems.
